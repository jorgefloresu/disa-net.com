NAME
	FLCKR - PmWiki 2 skin

DESCRIPTION

	The skin was inspired by the colors and layout of the site Flickr(http://www.flickr.com/).This skin is xhtml 1.0 (strict) and css is valid too. I'll keep updating to include new functionality and correct errors you may find.

	Actions and accesskeys are hardcoded in the skin, you won't have any success changing Site/Preferences or Site/PageActions, instead you have to edit the flckr.tmpl file to change it.

	It looks quite same in Internet Explorer and Firefox.

	If you are going to use in a UNIX enviroment, be sure to pay attention to permissions and ownership the files inside the zip file have no of those set.


INSTALLATION

	To add the theme to your PmWiki2 installation, follow these basic steps:
	    
	1. Download the theme archive and extract the files it contains.
	    
	2. Upload the directory 'flckr' to the pub/skins directory provided by PmWiki on your server.
	    
	3. Add the following to your local configuration file (config.php).

	    $Skin = 'flckr';

	4. Look at ownership and permission of files if you have any trouble.

MISC
